# NoSwearingAPI - Universal Text Filtering
Hey. Are you tired of getting out of bed, putting a Discord bot on your server, and returning to bed? Well, not anymore. With our newest API, we call the `NoSwearingAPI`. Yeah, terrible name. I get it. The name isn't important, though. We've made a simple universal tool that allows you to detect swearing on anything. This is the first version of this API, so expect bugs.

Anyways, screw the god damn yap. Here's what it can do that doesn't come with basic filters:
- Can detect swear words even if you modify it to where it isn't the actual word. (`s.h.i.t` or `f u c k`)
- It has an entire dictionary of swear words to detect any swear word.
- Completely universal with all projects that use Python. (https://python.org/)
- Open-sourced and unobfuscated, so it's free for everyone.
